        Properties of the neutron or X-ray beam at a given location. 

        This group is referenced
        by beamline component groups within the :ref:`NXinstrument` group or by the :ref:`NXsample` group. This group is
        especially valuable in storing the results of instrument simulations in which it is useful
        to specify the beam profile, time distribution etc. at each beamline component. Otherwise,
        its most likely use is in the :ref:`NXsample` group in which it defines the results of the neutron
        scattering by the sample, e.g., energy transfer, polarizations.

        Note that incident_wavelength and related fields can be a scalar values or arrays, depending on the use case.
        To support these use cases, the explicit dimensionality of these fields is not specified, but it can be inferred
        by the presense of and shape of accompanying fields, such as incident_wavelength_weights for a polychromatic beam.

            In the case of a monochromatic beam this is the scalar
            wavelength.

            Several other use cases are permitted, depending on the
            presence or absence of other incident_wavelength_X
            fields.

            In the case of a polychromatic beam this is an array of
            length **m** of wavelengths, with the relative weights
            in ``incident_wavelength_weights``.

            In the case of a monochromatic beam that varies shot-
            to-shot, this is an array of wavelengths, one for each
            recorded shot. Here, ``incident_wavelength_weights`` and
            incident_wavelength_spread are not set.

            In the case of a polychromatic beam that varies shot-to-
            shot, this is an array of length **m** with the relative
            weights in ``incident_wavelength_weights`` as a 2D array.

            In the case of a polychromatic beam that varies shot-to-
            shot and where the channels also vary, this is a 2D array
            of dimensions **nP** by **m** (slow to fast) with the
            relative weights in ``incident_wavelength_weights`` as a 2D
            array.

            Note, :ref:`variants &lt;Design-Variants&gt;` are a good way
            to represent several of these use cases in a single dataset,
            e.g. if a calibrated, single-value wavelength value is
            available along with the original spectrum from which it
            was calibrated.

            Further moments in **c** characterize co-variance terms, so
            the next moment is the product of the first two, and so on.

             Polarization vector on entering beamline component using Stokes notation

             The Stokes parameters are four components labelled I,Q,U,V or S_0,S_1,S_2,S_3.
             These are defined with the standard Nexus coordinate frame unless it is
             overridden by an NXtransformations field pointed to by a depends_on attribute.
             The last component, describing the circular polarization state, is positive
             for a right-hand circular state - that is the electric field vector rotates
             clockwise at the sample and over time when observed from the source.

             I is the beam intensity (often normalized to 1), and Q, U, and V are derived
             from p (the fractional degree of polarization), and the elliptical components
             Ψ and Χ (psi and chi). Ψ is the orientation angle of the polarization ellipse,
             relative to the x axis and increasing counter-clockwise around z. Χ is the
             ellipticity angle, or the arctan of the ratio of the minor/major axes of the
             polarization ellipse.
