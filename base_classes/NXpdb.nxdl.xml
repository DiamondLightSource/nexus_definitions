		A NeXus transliteration of a PDB file, to be validated only as a PDB
		rather than in NeXus.

		Use :ref:`NXpdb` to incorporate the information in an arbitrary
		PDB into a NeXus file.

		The main suggestion is to use this as a container
		class for a PDB entry to describe a sample in NXsample,
		but it may be more appropriate to place this higher in the
		hierarchy, say in NXentry.

		The structure has to follow the structure of a PDB
		with each PDB data block mapped to a NeXus group of class NXpdb,
		using a lowercase version of the data block name as the name
		of the NeXus group, each PDB category in that data block
		mapped to a NeXus group of class NXpdb and with each PDB column
		mapped to a NeXus field.  The columns in a looped PDB category
		should always be presented as arrays.  The columns in an unlooped
		PDB category should be presented as scalar values.  If a PDB category
		specifies particular units for columns, the same units should be
		used for the corresponding fields.

		All text data should be presented as quoted strings, with the quote
		marks except for the null values "." or "?".

		If a PDB null value, "." or "?", is contained in a numeric column, the
		IEEE nan should be used for "?" and the IEEE inf should be used for ".".

		For example, a PDB entry that begins::

			data_1YVA
			#
			 _entry.id   1YVA
			#
			_audit_conform.dict_name       mmcif_pdbx.dic
			_audit_conform.dict_version    5.279
			_audit_conform.dict_location   http://mmcif.pdb.org/dictionaries/ascii/mmcif_pdbx.dic
			#
			loop_
			_database_2.database_id
			_database_2.database_code
			PDB   1YVA
			RCSB  RCSB031959
			WWPDB D_1000031959
			#

		would produce::
	
			sample:NXsample
			   1yva:NXpdb
			     entry:NXpdb
			         id:"1YVA"
			     audit_conform:NXpdb
			         dict_name:"mmcif_pdbx.dic"
			         dict_version:"5.279"
			         dict_location:"http://mmcif.pdb.org/dictionaries/ascii/mmcif_pdbx.dic"
			     database_2:NXpdb
			         database_id:["PDB","RCSB","WWPDB"]
			         database_code:["1YVA","RCSB031959","D_1000031959"]
