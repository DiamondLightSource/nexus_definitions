  raw data from a single crystal diffractometer, extends :ref:`NXxbase`
  
  This is the application definition for raw data from 
  a single crystal diffractometer
  measuring in normal beam mode. It extends :ref:`NXxbase`, 
  so the full definition is the content of
  :ref:`NXxbase` plus the data defined here. All angles are 
  logged in order to support arbitrary scans in
  reciprocal space.
