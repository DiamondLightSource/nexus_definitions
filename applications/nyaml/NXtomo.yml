  This is the application definition for x-ray or neutron tomography raw data. 
  
  In tomography 
  a number of dark field images are measured, some bright field images and, of course the sample. 
  In order to distinguish between them images carry a image_key.

            In order
            to distinguish between sample projections, dark and flat
            images, a magic number is recorded per frame.
            The key is as follows:
            
            * projection = 0
            * flat field = 1
            * dark field = 2
            * invalid = 3

          In practice this axis is always aligned along one pixel direction on the detector and usually vertical.
          There are experiments with horizontal rotation axes, so this would need to be indicated somehow.
          For now the best way for that is an open question.
