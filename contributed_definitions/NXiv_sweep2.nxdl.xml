         Application definition for temperature-dependent IV curve measurements, 
         NOTE_: What is CAP
         #CAP with a focus on bias spectroscopy in scanning tunneling microscopy.
         
         In this application definition, times should be specified always together
         with an UTC offset.
         
         This is the application definition describing temperature (T) dependent current voltage (IV) curve
         measurements. For this a temperature is set. After reaching the temperature,
         a voltage sweep is performed. For each voltage a current is measured.
         Then, the next desired temperature is set and an IV measurement is performed.

                                 (averaging over specified period), mostly used in sweep modules. Examples are

                                 measurements with small steps, a value of 40 ms may be reasonable. For normal
                                 use, 300-500 ms is a good value, but for recording a resonance of a high-Q

                 This NXdata should contain separate fields for the current values at different temperature setpoints, for example current_at_100C.
                 There should also be two more fields called temperature and voltage containing the setpoint values.
                 There should also be a field with an array of rank equal to the number of different temperature setpoints and each child's dimension
                 equal to the number of voltage setpoints.
