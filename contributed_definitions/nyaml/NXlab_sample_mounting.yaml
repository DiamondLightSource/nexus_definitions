    # temperature control of the mounting (e.g. relevant when hot_mounting Al)
    # cleaning procedures
    # a descriptor of the shape of the specimen
    # borrow from NXlab_thermo_mechanical_processing to document the external
    # stimuli (eventually) applied during mounting
    # temperature, mechanical, magnetic, electro-magnetic, are externally
    # applied stimuli on the sample, can we use one master schema?
    # e.g. one can even store NXcg_polyhedron_set and NXcg_face_list_data_structure
    # instances to keep track of the geometry of specific instrument and how
    # the samples were arranged in these
    # key question is which steps has the sample experienced?
