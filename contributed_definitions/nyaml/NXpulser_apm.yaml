  Metadata for laser- and/or voltage-pulsing in atom probe microscopy.
symbols:
  doc: The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  n_ions: Total number of ions collected.
NXpulser_apm:
  (NXfabrication):
  pulse_mode:
    doc: |
      How is field evaporation physically triggered.
    enumeration: [laser, voltage, laser_and_voltage]
  pulse_frequency(NX_FLOAT):
    doc: |
      Frequency with which the high voltage or laser pulser fires.
    unit: NX_FREQUENCY
    # This can change over the course of the experiment, APT HDF defines it therefore as follows: "PulseFrequency : Real array, 2xn (Hz) This is the frequency of the high voltage or laser pulser. first entry : first pulse number where the spacing between this and all subsequent pulses are considered to be at the selected frequency. Each first entry must be strictly increasing in value. The second entry contains the frequency value" as data can be compressed in this case very efficiently we go for with an array of length 1xn_ions

  pulse_fraction(NX_FLOAT):
    doc: |
      Fraction of the pulse_voltage that is applied in addition
      to the standing_voltage at peak voltage of a pulse.
      
      If a standing voltage is applied, this gives nominal pulse fraction
      (as a function of standing voltage). Otherwise this field should not be
      present.

  pulsed_voltage(NX_FLOAT):
    doc: |
      In laser pulsing mode the values will be zero so the this field is recommended.
      However, for voltage pulsing mode it is highly recommended that users report the pulsed_voltage.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
    dimensions:
      rank: 1
      dim: [[1, n_ions]]
  pulse_number(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      Absolute number of pulses starting from the beginning of the experiment.
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    dimensions:
      rank: 1
      dim: [[1, n_ions]]
  standing_voltage(NX_FLOAT):
    doc: |
      Direct current voltage between the specimen and the (local electrode) in
      the case of local electrode atom probe (LEAP) instrument.
      The standing voltage applied to the sample, relative to system ground.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE

  laser_gun(NXsource):
    doc: |
      Atom probe microscopes use controlled laser, voltage,
      or a combination of pulsing strategies to trigger the
      excitation and eventual field evaporation/emission of
      an ion during an experiment.

    wavelength(NX_FLOAT):
      doc: Nominal wavelength of the laser radiation.

    pulse_energy(NX_FLOAT):
      doc: Average energy of the laser at peak of each pulse.
      # NEW ISSUE: needs clearer specification/definition
      unit: NX_ENERGY
    (NXtransformations):
      doc: |
        Affine transformations which describe the geometry how the
        laser focusing optics/pinhole-attached coordinate system is
        defined, how it has to be transformed so that it aligns with
        the specimen coordinate system.
        A right-handed Cartesian coordinate system, the so-called laser space,
        should be assumed, whose positive z-axis points
        into the direction of the propagating laser beam.

  laser_beam(NXbeam):
    doc: |
      Details about specific positions along the focused laser beam
      which illuminates the (atom probe) specimen.
    incidence_vector(NXcollection):
      doc: |
        Track time-dependent settings over the course of the
        measurement how the laser beam in tip space/reconstruction space
        laser impinges on the sample, i.e. the mean vector is parallel to
        the laser propagation direction.
    pinhole_position(NXcollection):  # NXsnapshot, NXcg_point_set
      doc: |
        Track time-dependent settings over the course of the
        measurement where the laser beam exits the 
        focusing optics.
    spot_position(NXcollection):  # NXsnapshot, NXcg_point_set
      doc: |
        Track time-dependent settings over the course of the
        measurement where the laser hits the specimen.
