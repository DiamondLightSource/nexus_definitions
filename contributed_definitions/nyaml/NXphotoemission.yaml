          source, not of the output beam. For example, the energy of the source is not the
          optical power of the beam, but the energy of the electron beam in a synchrotron
          and so on.

              The data which is considered raw might change from experiment to experiment
              due to hardware pre-processing of the data.
              This field ideally collects the data with the lowest level of processing
              possible.

              The naming of fields should follow a convention to ensure compatibility.
              It is recommend to use the following field names:

              - **angular1**: Slow-axis angular coordinate (or second fast axis if simultaneously dispersed in 2 dimensions)
                Unit category: NX_ANGLE

          For energy referencing, the measured energies are corrected for the charging potential
          (i.e., the electrical potential of the surface region of an insulating sample, caused by
          irradiation) such that those energies correspond to a sample with no surface charge.
          Usually, the energy axis is adjusted by shifting all energies uniformally until one
          well-defined emission line peak (or the Fermi edge) is located at a known _correct_ energy.

            This is the calibrated energy axis to be used for data plotting.

        doc: |
          In the transmission correction, each intensity measurement for electrons of a given
          kinetic energy is multiplied by the corresponding value in the relative_intensity
          field of the transmission_function. This calibration procedure is used to account for
          the different tranmsission efficiencies when using different lens modes.

            Transmission function of the electron analyser.
            
            The transmission function (TF) specifies the detection efficiency for electrons of
            different kinetic energy passing through the electron analyser.
            This can be a link to /entry/instrument/electronanalyser/transmission_function.

          A descriptor to keep track of the treatment of the sample before entering the

          In the case of a fixed temperature measurement this is the scalar temperature of
          the sample. In the case of an experiment in which the temperature is changed and
          recoded, this is an array of length m of temperatures. This should be a link to
          /entry/instrument/manipulator/sample_temperature.

    (NXdata):
      doc: |
        An NXdata field containing a view on the measured data.
        This NXdata field contains a collection of the main relevant fields (axes).
        In NXmpes, it is required to provide an ``energy`` axis (Unit category: NX_ENERGY).
        The other data fields ideally should be named according to conventions
        to ensure compatibility. We recommened the following field names
        for common data fields:

        - **kx**: Calibrated x axis in k-space. Unit category: NX_ANY (e.g., 1/Angström).
        - **ky**: Calibrated y axis in k-space. Unit category: NX_ANY (1/Angström).
        - **kz**: Calibrated z axis in k-space. Unit category: NX_ANY (1/Angström).
        - **angular0**: Fast-axis angular coordinate (or second slow axis if angularly integrated).
          Unit category: NX_ANGLE
        - **angular1**: Slow-axis angular coordinate (or second fast axis if simultaneously dispersed in 2 dimensions)
          Unit category: NX_ANGLE
        - **spatial0**: Fast-axis spatial coordinate (or second slow axis if spatially integrated)
          Unit category: NX_LENGTH
        - **spatial1**: Slow-axis spatial coordinate (or second fast axis if simultaneously dispersed in 2 dimensions)
          Unit category: NX_LENGTH
        - **delay**: Calibrated delay time. Unit category: NX_TIME (s).
        - **polarization_angle**: Linear polarization angle of the incoming or
          outgoing beam. This could be a link to
          /entry/instrument/beam/incident_polarization_angle or
          /entry/instrument/beam/final_polarization_angle if they exist.
          Unit category: NX_ANGLE (° or rad)
        - **ellipticity**: Ellipticity of the incoming or outgoing beam.
          Could be a link to /entry/instrument/beam/incident_ellipticity or
          /entry/instrument/beam/final_ellipticity if they exist.
          Unit category: NX_ANGLE (° or rad)

          Represents a measure of one- or more-dimensional photoemission counts, where the
          varied axis may be for example energy, momentum, spatial coordinate, pump-probe
          delay, spin index, temperature, etc. The axes traces should be linked to the
          actual encoder position in NXinstrument or calibrated axes in NXprocess.
