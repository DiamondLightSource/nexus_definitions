  tunneling_current(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The tunneling current between tip and sample after application of bias voltage.

  gain(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: Proportional relationship between the probe output voltage and the actual 
         tunneling current when measuring the tunneling current.
  channels(NX_CHAR):
    doc: The scan channels are selected by users (in scan contronaller).

  signals_oversampling(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: he Signals Period refers to the rate at which signals are transferred to the host 
      computer, which is running the control software. Typically, this rate can be reduced by a factor 
      of 10 compared to the sampling rate, as the real-time engine internally oversamples the signal. 
      If necessary, you have the option to decrease the oversampling to 1, allowing for enhanced 
      resolution of higher frequencies in the Spectrum Analyzer.
    unit: NX_ANY
  acquisition_period(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The update rate for various processes, such as the History Graph, Auto-Approach, and several 
      Programming Interface functions, may be set to 20 ms. Any additional timings (7-9) must be integer 
      multiples of this base value. While you have the flexibility to set these additional timings to 
      different values, the actual timing value will automatically be adjusted to become a multiple of 
      the Acquisition Period.
    unit: NX_TIME
  animations_period(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The update rate for animated graphical indicators, including graphs and sliders, may be set to 
      40 ms (25 updates per second), which is considered reasonable. Increasing this period can help 
      lessen the processor load on the graphical user interface, particularly on slower computers. It is 
      important to note that this value solely affects the user interface update rate and has no impact 
      on measurements whatsoever.
    unit: NX_TIME
  indicators_period(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The update rate for digital indicators, such as the numbers displayed beside each slider, may be 
      set to 3 updates per second or 300 ms, which is sufficient. It is important to note that this 
      value exclusively affects the user interface update rate and has no impact on measurements whatsoever.
    unit: NX_TIME
  measurements_period(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The Measurements period represents the integration time for precise measurements, often utilized 
      in sweep modules. It is particularly useful for tasks like recording force-distance curves or 
      cantilever resonances. For swift measurements with small steps, a value of 40 ms may be appropriate. 
      For regular use, a range of 300-500 ms may be recommended, but when capturing the resonance of a high-Q 
      cantilever, longer values in the range of several seconds might be necessary. Typically, this 
      parameter does not require manual adjustment within this module; the sweep modules automatically 
      set this value based on the sweep timings.
    unit: NX_TIME
  number_of_outputs(NX_INT):
    doc: Number of output channels
output_cabling(NXcircuit):
  output_mode(NX_CHAR):
    doc: The user output in each monitor mode.
  output_value(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: The values for each output channel.
    unit: NX_ANY
  output_name(NX_CHAR):
    doc: User outputs whose name can be modified in the corresponding module.
  output_slew_rate(NX_CHAR):
    doc: The rate at which the one of the signal changes when ramping to the starting point. (V/s)
