  Alternatively, notes allows for additional descriptors in any format.

NXsample_history(NXobject):
  (NXactivity):
    doc: |
      Any activity that was performed on the sample prior or during the experiment.
      Examples include measurements or sample treatments.
  notes(NXnote):
    doc: |
      A descriptor to keep track of the treatment of the sample before or during the
      experiment (NXnote allows to add pictures, audio, movies). Alternatively, a
      reference to the location or a unique identifier or other metadata file. In the
      case these are not available, free-text description.
      This should only be used in case that there is no rigorous description using NXactivity.
