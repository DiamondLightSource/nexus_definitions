category: base
doc: |
  A set of activities that occurred to  the sample prior/during experiment.
  Ideally, a full report of the previous operations (or links to a chain of operations).
  Alternatively, notes allow for additional descriptors in any format.
type: group
NXsample_history(NXobject):
  (NXactivity):
    doc:
      Any activity that was performed on the sample prior or during the experiment.
      In the future, if there is base class inheritance, this can describe any activity, 
      including processes and measurements.
      # For now, one workaround would be to have NXactivity as a application definition with a subentry.
      # subentry(NXsuxbentry):
      #   doc: |
      #     Any activity that was performed on the sample prior or during the experiment.
      #   definition: ["NXactivity"]
  (NXphysical_process):
    doc: |
      Any physical process that was performed on the sample prior or during the experiment.
  (NXchemical_process):
    doc: |
      Any chemical process that was performed on the sample prior or during the experiment.
  # There should be more activities here, like measurement. 
  notes(NXnote):
    doc: |
      A descriptor to keep track of the treatment of the sample before or during the
      experiment (NXnote allows to add pictures, audio, movies). Alternatively, a
      reference to the location or a unique identifier or other metadata file. In the
      case these are not available, free-text description.
      This should only be used in case that there is no rigorous description
      using the base classes above. This field can also be used to pull in any activities
      that are not well described by an existing base class definition.
