      Triplet of the minimum, increment, and maximum identifier to include
      for a linear sequence of identifier. The increment controls which n-th
      identifier (value) to take.
      
      Take as an example a dataset with 100 identifier (aka entries provided
      their identifier start at zero, i.e. identifier_offset is 0). Assume that linear_range_min_incr_max
      is set to [0, 1, 99]. This will process each identifier. 0, 2, 99 will take each second identifier.
      90, 3, 99 will take each third identifier beginning from identifier 90 up to 99.
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    dim: (3,)
    # TODO clarify that identifier are in id_offset, id_offset + 1, idoffset + 2, idoffset + n
