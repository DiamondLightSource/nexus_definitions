  Base class for simulating ion extraction from matter via laser and/or voltage pulsing.
  
  Ideally, we would like to describe the workflow of experiments and simulations of atom probe and
  field-evaporation simulation research in more detail and contextualize better descriptions of
  experiments and computer simulations. The strategy is detailed in the introducing docstring
  of :ref:`NXapm_msr`. This base class is envisioned as the twin of the :ref:`NXapm_msr` base class.
# noteworthy the situation is similar to electron microscopy especially transmission electron microscopy where factually
# interpretation without simulations is pointless. The only difference is that in electron microscopy there is a large availability
# of documentation and open-source tools for performing such simulations.
