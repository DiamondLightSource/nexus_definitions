  n: |
    Number of ions spatially filtered from results of the hit_finding algorithm
    from which an instance of a reconstructed volume has been generated.
    These ions get new identifier assigned in the process, this is the so-called
    evaporation_identifier that is not to be confused with the pulse_identifier!

    Data post-processing step to correct for ion impact position
    flight path differences, detector biases, and nonlinearities.
    This step is usually performed with commercial software.

  # NEW ISSUE: realistic is that currently scientists can pull always a calibrated time-of-flight
  # but not necessarily unprocessed timing data from the detector (unless individuals built the instrument).
  # Relevant for ranging are the calibrated data, thats why only these
  # (as an intermediate/compromise solution) are required in this version of the application definition
