  Metadata to ranging definitions made for a dataset in atom probe microscopy.
  
  Ranging is the process of labeling time-of-flight data with so-called iontypes.
  Iontypes ideally specify the most likely (molecular) ion that is assumed of having
  been evaporated and laying within a mass-to-charge-state-ratio value interval.
  
  The so-called UNKNOWNTYPE iontype represents the null model of an event/ion
  that has not been ranged. The identifier of this special iontype is always 0.

      Name of the (parent) group (prefix to the individual ranging definitions)
      inside the file referred to by path which points to the specific ranging
      definition to use.
      Container files can store multiple ranging definitions.
      Using an identifier allows for a distinction which specific
      definitions to apply.
      
      Remember that the identifier of the reconstruction and ranging definitions
      can differ despite the fact that using the same filenames for the reconstruction
      and ranging definitions files has become common practice.
