  Data artifact representing a tomographic reconstruction in atom probe microscopy.
  
  Typically, reconstructions in the field of atom probe tomography are communicated
  via files which store reconstructed ion positions and mass-to-charge-state-ratio values.
  Container files like HDF5 can store multiple reconstructions. This base class specifies
  which specific reconstruction one likes to refer to.
