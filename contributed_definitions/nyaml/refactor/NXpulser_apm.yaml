symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  n_events: |
    Total number of events along a time trajectory, not necessarily the same as ions.

NXpulser_apm(NXobject):
  (NXfabrication):
  pulse_mode(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Detail whereby ion extraction is trigger methodologically.
    enumeration: [laser, voltage, laser_and_voltage]
  pulse_frequency(NX_FLOAT):
    doc: |
      Frequency with which the high voltage or laser pulser fires.
      
      For this and other fields whose dimensions are parameterized
      with n_events these values can change over the course of the experiment.
      In the simplest case the field stores a scalar value that is ideally
      the actual value not the set value. 
    # APT HDF defines it therefore as follows: "PulseFrequency : Real array, 2xn (Hz) This is the frequency of the high voltage or laser pulser. first entry : first pulse number where the spacing between this and all subsequent pulses are considered to be at the selected frequency. Each first entry must be strictly increasing in value. The second entry contains the frequency value" as data can be compressed in this case very efficiently we go for with an array of length 1xn_ions
    dim: (n_events,)
  pulse_fraction(NX_FLOAT):
    doc: |
      Fraction of the pulse_voltage that is applied in addition
      to the standing_voltage at peak voltage of a pulse.
      
      If a standing voltage is applied, this gives nominal pulse fraction
      (as a function of standing voltage). Otherwise, 
      this field should not be present.
    unit: NX_DIMENSIONLESS
    dim: (n_events,)
  pulsed_voltage(NX_FLOAT):
    doc: |
      In laser pulsing mode the values will be zero so the this field is recommended.
      However, for voltage pulsing mode it is highly recommended that users report the pulsed_voltage.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
    dim: (n_events,)
  pulse_number(NX_UINT):
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    doc: |
      Absolute number of pulses starting from the beginning of the experiment.
    dim: (n_events,)
  standing_voltage(NX_FLOAT):
    doc: |
      Direct current voltage between the specimen and the (local electrode) in
      the case of local electrode atom probe (LEAP) instrument. Otherwise, the
      standing voltage applied to the sample, relative to system ground.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
    dim: (n_events,)
  (NXsource):
    doc: |
      Atom probe microscopes use controlled laser, voltage, or a combination of pulsing strategies
      to trigger the excitation and eventual field evaporation/emission of an ion during an experiment.
    name(NX_CHAR):
      doc: |
        Given name/alias.
    (NXfabrication):
    wavelength(NX_FLOAT):
      doc: |
        Nominal wavelength of the laser radiation.
      unit: NX_WAVELENGTH
    power(NX_FLOAT):
      doc: |
        Nominal power of the laser source while illuminating the specimen.
      unit: NX_POWER
    # NEW ISSUE: needs clearer specification/definition
    pulse_energy(NX_FLOAT):
      doc: |
        Average energy of the laser at peak of each pulse.
      unit: NX_ENERGY
    (NXbeam):
      doc: |
        Details about specific positions along the focused laser beam
        which illuminates the (atom probe) specimen.
      incidence_vector(NXcollection):
        doc: |
          Track time-dependent settings over the course of the
          measurement how the laser beam in tip space/reconstruction space
          laser impinges on the sample, i.e. the mean vector is parallel to
          the laser propagation direction.
      pinhole_position(NXcollection):
        doc: |
          Track time-dependent settings over the course of the
          measurement where the laser beam exits the
          focusing optics.
      spot_position(NXcollection):
        doc: |
          Track time-dependent settings over the course of the
          measurement where the laser hits the specimen.
    (NXtransformations):
      doc: |
        Affine transformations which describe the geometry how the
        laser focusing optics/pinhole-attached coordinate system is
        defined, how it has to be transformed so that it aligns with
        the specimen coordinate system.
        A right-handed Cartesian coordinate system, the so-called laser space,
        should be assumed, whose positive z-axis points
        into the direction of the propagating laser beam.
