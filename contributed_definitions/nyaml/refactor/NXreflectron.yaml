  Device for reducing flight time differences of ions in ToF experiments.
  
  For atom probe the reflectron can be considered an energy_compensation
  device, which can e.g. be realized technically as via a Poschenrieder lens
  
  Consult the following U.S. patents for further details:
  
  * 3863068 and 6740872 for the reflectron
  * 8134119 for the curved reflectron

      Free-text field to specify further details about the reflectron.
      The field can be used to inform e. g. if the reflectron is flat or curved.
  # IFES_APT_TC "ReflectronVoltage: Real, 1xn array (V) Must be present if ReflectronInfo is not “None” The maximum voltage applied to the reflectron, relative to system ground."
  (NXtransformations):
    doc: |
      Affine transformation(s) which detail where the reflectron is located relative
      to e.g. the origin of the specimen space reference coordinate system.
      This group can also be used for specifying how the reflectron
      is rotated relative to a given axis in the instrument.
    # The purpose of these more detailed instrument descriptions
    # is to support the creation of a digital twin of the instrument
    # for computational science.
