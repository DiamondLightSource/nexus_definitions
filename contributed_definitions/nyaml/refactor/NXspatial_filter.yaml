  Spatial filter to filter objects within a region-of-interest (ROI) based position.
  
  Objects can be points, other geometric primitives or objecs composed from
  other geometric primitives.

    Number of cylinders.
  n_ellipsoids: |
    Number of ellipsoids.

      Qualitative statement which describes the logical operations
      that define which objects will be included and which excluded:
      
      * entire_dataset, no filter is applied, all objects are used.
      * union_of_primitives, a filter with (possibly non-axis-aligned) geometric
        primitives. Objects in or on the surface of the primitives are considered.
        All other objects are excluded.
      * bitmask, a boolean array whose bits encode with 1 which objects
        are included. Bits set to zero encode which objects
        are excluded. Users of python can use the bitfield operations
        of the numpy package to define such bitfields.
      
# In the case that windowing_method is union_of_primitives,
# it is possible to specify none or all types of primitives
# (ellipsoids, cylinder, hexahedra). If no primitives are specified
# the filter falls back to entire_dataset.
# In the case that windowing_method is bitmask, the bitmask has to be defined;
# otherwise the filter falls back to entire dataset.
    enumeration: [entire_dataset, union_of_primitives, bitmask]
