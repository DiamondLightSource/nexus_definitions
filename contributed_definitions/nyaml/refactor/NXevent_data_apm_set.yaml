  Base class for a set of :ref:`NXevent_data_apm` instances.
  
  Members of the set are instances of :ref:`NXevent_data_apm`.
  These have an associated time interval during which the conditions
  of the instrument were considered stable and fit enough for purpose.
  
  Which temporal granularity is adequate depends on the situation and
  research question. Using a model which enables a collection of events offers
  the most flexible way to cater for both experiments with controlled electron
  beams in a real microscope or the simulation of such experiments or
  individual aspects of such experiments.
  
  To monitor the course of an ion extraction experiment (or simulation)
  it makes sense to track either time explicitly with time stamps or implicitly
  via e.g. a clock inside the instrument, such as the clock of the pulser.
  
  As set and measured quantities typically change over time and we do not
  yet know during the measurement which of the events have associated
  molecular ions that will end up in the reconstructed volume we must not
  document quantities as a function of the evaporated_identifier but as a
  function of the (pulsing)event_identifier.
