  crystallographic_database_identifier:
    doc: |
      Identifier of an entry resolvable via crystallographic_database
      which was used for creating this structure model.

  lattice_system:
    doc: |
      A lattice system is a group of lattices with the same set of lattice point groups.
      For further information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_system.
    enumeration: [triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, rhombohedral, hexagonal, cubic]
  space_group:
    doc: |
      Crystallographic space group. 
      A space group is the symmetry group of a repeating pattern in space.
      For further information, see International Table for Crystallography (https://it.iucr.org/).
  point_group:
    doc: |
      Crystallographic point group.
      A crystallographic point group is a set of symmetry operations, corresponding to one of the point groups in three dimensions, 
      such that each operation (perhaps followed by a translation) would leave the structure of a crystal unchanged.
      This field should use Schoenflies notation (see Schoenflies, A., Krystallsysteme und Krystallstructur, 1891).
      For further information, see https://dictionary.iucr.org/Point_group.
  laue_group:
    doc: |
      Laue group (also called Laue class).
      The Laue classes are eleven geometric crystal classes containing centrosymmetric crystallographic types of point groups and their subgroups.
      When absorption is negligible and Friedel's law applies, it is impossible to distinguish by diffraction between a centrosymmetric point group 
      and one of its non-centrosymmetric subgroups; only point groups belonging to different Laue classes can then be distinguished.
      For further information, see https://dictionary.iucr.org/Laue_class.

  is_centrosymmetric(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: |
      True if space group is considered a centrosymmetric one.
      False if space group is considered a non-centrosymmetric one.
      Centrosymmetric has all types and combinations of symmetry elements
      (translation, rotational axis, mirror planes, center of inversion)
      Non-centrosymmetric compared to centrosymmetric is constrained (no inversion).
      Chiral compared to non-centrosymmetric is constrained (no mirror planes).
  is_chiral(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: |
      True if space group is considered a chiral one.
      False if space group is consider a non-chiral one.

      The value 0 is reserved for the unknown phase which represents the null-model
      that no phase model was sufficiently significantly confirmed.
