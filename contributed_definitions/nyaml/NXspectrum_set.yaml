symbols:
# n_p: Number of scan points
  n_y: Number of pixel in the slow direction.
  n_x: Number of pixel in the fast direction.
  n_energy: Number of energy bins.
NXspectrum_set:
  (NXprocess):
    doc: |
      Details how spectra were processed from the detector readings.
    source:
      doc: |
        Resolvable data artifact (e.g. filename) from which the all values in
        the NXdata instances in this NXspectrum_set were loaded during parsing.
      \@version:
        doc: |
          An at least as strong as SHA256 hashvalue of the data artifact which
          source represents digitally to support provenance tracking.
    mode:
      doc: |
        Imaging (data collection) mode of the instrument during acquisition
        of the data in this NXspectrum_set instance.
    detector_identifier:
      doc: |
        Link or name of an NXdetector instance with which the data were collected.

  # ##MK::feel free to contact us when you would like to include more complicated scan pattern than rectangular ones.
  stack(NXdata):
    doc: | 
      Collected spectra for all pixels of a rectangular region-of-interest.
      This representation supports rectangular scan pattern.
