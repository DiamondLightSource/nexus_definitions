# Key difficulties:
#   Several viewpoints are equally justified: Grains useful when there are crystallites with adjoining interfaces and 
#   none, or only some statistical populations of defects and/or some spatially-well defined defects, but if there are
#   almost only defects like in a dislocation wall it might no longer be useful to define the grains as a well identifiable region whose majority volume
#   shows long-range periodicity (so that defining an orientation makes) sense. Or should one better describe individual material points
#   or atoms set of atoms forming a compact object with same grouping and same identifier?
#   Lattice curvature, this is jargon with some truth in it but curvature has to be build from atom defects need to build the curvature
#   average density, total, per character, per family, line length, curvature, jog, kink density, coarse-grainable structural motifs, atomic structure
#   still all a models as thermal oscillations render that regions about a dislocation line segment oscillate change sub-nanometer arrangement frequently
#   different scales relevant when coupling to specific mechanisms (e.g. phonons)
#   ambiguous choices: is the grain boundary part of the grain or is it an own defect?
#   i.e. can/should we store grains as childs of their grain boundary set vs the interface the childs of the grains?
#   ?? right now can couple gr has gB but if gr is specialized can it still have a gB
#   a member of grain boundary
#   Depending on use case a continuum of descriptors: is used mapping the meaning of terms can be as simple as employing logical
#   relations crystallite is a synonym for grain versus a grain is described programmatically as the resulting cluster of atoms with constraint
#   Length scale of homogeneity:
#   In a multi-parameter space of all possible methods and effects and different external stimuli applied, simulations in computational materials science 
#   make sense when they focus on often very narrowly constrained effects and boundary conditions for which the simulation is formulated and useful.
#   Data structures for multi-scale materials modeling IMM/ICME are diverse because they reflect these needs and specific main choices of what these simulation
#   e.g. DFT (time, length-scale, which electronic effects)
#   RVE annealing phenomena at the micrometer scale (pressure, temperature, length scale, interactions considered or not)
#   Some regions are well separated spatially (although it can be non-trivial to quantify the distance in a multi-dim parameter space)
#   Some are overlapping (classical MD at the cutting edge with micrometer crystal plasticity microsecond and/or annealing at ns time scale)
#   MD with classical vs abinitio-informed potential for studying evolution of mechanisms and phenomena at different length scale
