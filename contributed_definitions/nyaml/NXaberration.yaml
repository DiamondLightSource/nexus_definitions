      For the CEOS definitions the C aberrations are radial-symmetric and have no
      angle entry, while the A, B, D, S, or R aberrations are n-fold
      symmetric and have an angle entry.
      For the NION definitions the coordinate system differs to the one
      used in CEOS and instead two aberration coefficients a and b are used.
