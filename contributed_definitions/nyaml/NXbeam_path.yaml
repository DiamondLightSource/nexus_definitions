# A draft of a new base class to describe a beam path consisting of one or
# more optical elements (e.g. a beam path in a luminescence setup).

# To do:
# [ ] Harmonize common fields/classes among base classes used in NXbeam_path,
#     e.g. NXshape in NXbeam_splitter and NXpolarizer_opt, or NXsample used for
#     describing substrates and coatings etc.
# [ ] How to describe a setup or beam path? Order/sequence defined by
#     NXtransformations? => discussion needed

  A beam path consisting of one or more optical elements.

  NXbeam_path is used in NXopt to describe the beam path, i.e. the arrangement
  of optical elements between the excitation source and the sample, or between
  the sample and the detector unit.

  To describe the order of the elements, use 'order(NXtransformations)', where
  each element's position points to the preceding element via '@depends_on'.
  Special case beam splitter: A beam splitter is a device which separates the
  beam into two or more beams. If such a device is part of the beam path use
  two or more NXbeam_paths to describe the beam paths after the beam splitter.
  In this case, in the dependency chain of the new beam paths, the first
  elements each point to the beam splitter, as this is the previous element.

    Describe the relevant optical elements in the beam path by using the
    appropriate base classes. in NXopt_element You may use as many elements as
    needed, also several elements of the same type as long as each element has
    its own name.

  depends_on:
    doc: |
      Entry point of the dependency chain defined by the NXtransformations
      field, i.e. a link to the first element in the beam path.
      Example: /entry/instrument/beam_path/radiation_source.

  (NXtransformations):
  # Possibilities:
  # (1) Modify NXtransformations to include properties that modify the light beam
  # (e.g. polarization state) instead (or in addition) to transformations like
  # translation and rotation
  # (2) Base class similar to NXtransformations but for changes of optical
  # properties (e.g. polarization state).

      Specify the order of the optical elements by defining a dependency chain.
      For each element, a '@depends_on' attribute should be used to state the
      position of the element in the beam path by pointing to the previous
      element. For the very first element, use the string "." instead.
    AXISNAME(NX_NUMBER):
      doc: |
        For each element in the beam path, one such field must exist with a
        '@depends_on' attribute defined to specify its position in the beam
        path. Note that also 'NXopt/ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/sample_stage' and windows
        ('NXopt/ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/sample_stage/entry_window' and
        'NXopt/ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/sample_stage/exit_window') may be added to the
        dependency chain, i.e. may have an entry in this class even if they are
        not described in the beam path.
        ELEMENT is a place holder for the name of an optical beam path element.
        Note that the name of this field must be exactly the same as the
        element's field name.
