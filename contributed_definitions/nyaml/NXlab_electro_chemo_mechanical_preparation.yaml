      rotation_control:

          Qualitative statement how the revelation of the machine was configured.
          If the rotation was controlled manually, e.g. by turning knobs
          choose manual and estimate the nominal average rotation.
          If the rotation was controlled via choosing from a fixed set
          of options offered by the machine choose fixed and
          specify the nominal rotation.
          If programmed use rotation_history (e.g. for automated/robot systems).

          Qualitative statement how the (piston) force with which the sample

          If the force was controlled manually e.g. by turning knobs
          choose manual and estimate nominal average force.
          If the force was controlled via choosing from a fixed set
