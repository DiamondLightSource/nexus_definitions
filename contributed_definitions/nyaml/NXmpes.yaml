          List of comma-separated elements from the periodic table

          Description of the surface preparation technique for the XPS experiment, i.e.
          UHV cleaving, in-situ growth, sputtering/annealing etc. Ideally, a full report
          of the previous operations, in any format(NXnote allows to add pictures, audio,
          movies). Alternatively, a reference to the location or a unique identifier or

          In the case of a fixed temperature measurement this is the scalar temperature of
          the sample. In the case of an experiment in which the temperature is changed and
          recoded, this is an array of length m of temperatures. This should be a link to
          /entry/instrument/manipulator/sample_temperature.

          Represents a measure of one- or more-dimensional photoemission counts, where the
          varied axis may be for example energy, momentum, spatial coordinate, pump-probe
          delay, spin index, temperature, etc. The axes traces should be linked to the
