    measurement:
      enumeration: [voltage]
    value(NX_FLOAT):

  (NXactuator):
    doc: |
      Any additional actuator on the manipulator used to control an external condition.

      Any additional sensors on the manipulator used to monitor an external condition.
  (NXpositioner):
    doc: |
      Class to describe the motors that are used in the manipulator
  depends_on(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Refers to the last transformation specifying the positon of the manipulator in
      the NXtransformations chain.
  (NXtransformations):
    doc: |
      Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe the location and
      geometry of the manipulator as a component in the instrument. Conventions from
      the NXtransformations base class are used. In principle, the McStas coordinate
      system is used. The first transformation has to point either to another
      component of the system or . (for pointing to the reference frame) to relate it
      relative to the experimental setup. Typically, the components of a system should
      all be related relative to each other and only one component should relate to
      the reference coordinate system.
