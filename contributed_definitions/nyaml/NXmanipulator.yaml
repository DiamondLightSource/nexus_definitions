  Extension of NXpositioner to include fields to describe the use of manipulators
  in photoemission experiments.
type: group
NXmanipulator(NXobject):
  name(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Name of the manipulator.
  description(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      A description of the manipulator.
  type(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Type of manipulator, Hexapod, Rod, etc.
  cryocoolant(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: |
      Is cryocoolant flowing through the manipulator?
  cryostat(NXactuator):
    doc: |
      Cryostat for cooling the sample.
  sample_heater(NXactuator):
    doc: |
      Device for applying heating power for temperature control.
  sample_thermocouple(NXsensor):
    doc: |
      Sensor to measure the temperature at the closest point to the sample. 
      
      This field may also be found in NXsample if present.
  drain_current_amperemeter(NXsensor):
    doc: |
      Current to neutralize the photoemission current. 
      
      This field may also be found in NXsample if present.
  sample_bias_voltmeter(NXsensor):
    doc: |
      Device to measure/set possible bias of the sample with respect to analyser ground.
      
      This field may also be found in NXsample if present.
  (NXactuator):
    doc: |
      Any additional sensors on the manipulator used to control an external condition. 
  (NXsensor):
    doc: |
      Any additional sensors on the manipulator used to monitor an external condition. 
  (NXpositioner):
    doc: |
      Class to describe the motors that are used in the manipulator
  depends_on(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Refers to the last transformation specifying the positon of the manipulator in
      the NXtransformations chain.
  (NXtransformations):
    doc: |
      Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe the location and
      geometry of the manipulator as a component in the instrument. Conventions from
      the NXtransformations base class are used. In principle, the McStas coordinate
      system is used. The first transformation has to point either to another
      component of the system or . (for pointing to the reference frame) to relate it
      relative to the experimental setup. Typically, the components of a system should
      all be related relative to each other and only one component should relate to
      the reference coordinate system.
