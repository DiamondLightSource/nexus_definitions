symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays
  ncoeff: |
    Number of coefficients of the calibration function
  nfeat: |
    Number of features used to fit the calibration function

NXcalibration(NXobject):
  last_process(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Indicates the name of the last operation applied in the NXprocess sequence.
  applied(NX_BOOLEAN):
    doc: |
      Has the calibration been applied?
  coefficients(NX_FLOAT):
    unit: NX_ANY
    doc: |
      For non-linear energy calibrations, e.g. in a TOF, a polynomial function is fit
      to a set of features (peaks) at well defined energy positions to determine
      E(TOF). Here we can store the array of fit coefficients.
    dimensions:
      rank: 1
      dim: [[1, ncoeff]]
  fit_function(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      For non-linear energy calibrations. Here we can store the formula of the
      fit function.
      
      Use a0, a1, ..., an for the coefficients, corresponding to the values in the coefficients field.
      
      Use x0, x1, ..., xn for the variables.
      
      The formula should be numpy compliant.
  scaling(NX_FLOAT):
    unit: NX_ANY
    doc: |
      For linear calibration. Scaling parameter.
  offset(NX_FLOAT):
    unit: NX_ANY
    doc: |
      For linear calibration. Offset parameter.
  calibrated_axis(NX_FLOAT):
    unit: NX_ANY
    doc: |
      A vector representing the axis after calibration, matching the data length
    dimensions:
      rank: 1
      dim: [[1, ncal]]
  original_axis(NX_FLOAT):
    unit: NX_ANY
    doc: |
      Vector containing the data coordinates in the original uncalibrated axis
    dimensions:
      rank: 1
      dim: [[1, ncal]]
  description:
    doc: |
      A description of the procedures employed.
  calibration_file(NXnote):
    doc: |
      File containing the input data for calibration.
  MAPPING(NXdata):
    doc: |
      Mapping data for calibration.

      This can be used to map data points from uncalibrated 
      to calibrated values, e.g., by multiplying each point by the
      corresponding point in the mapping data.
