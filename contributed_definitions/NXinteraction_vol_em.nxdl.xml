         Base class for storing details about a modelled shape of interaction volume.
         
         The interaction volume is mainly relevant in scanning electron microscopy
         when the sample is thick enough so that the beam is unable to illuminate
         through the specimen.
         Computer models like Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics / electron beam
         interaction simulations can be used to qualify and/or quantify the shape of
         the interaction volume.
         
         Explicit or implicit descriptions are possible.
         
         * An implicit description is via a set of electron/specimen interactions
           represented ideally as trajectory data from the computer simulation.
         * An explicit description is via an iso-contour surface using either
           a simulation grid or a triangulated surface mesh of the approximated
           iso-contour surface evaluated at specific threshold values.
           Iso-contours could be computed from electron or particle fluxes through
           an imaginary control surface (the iso-surface).
           Threshold values can be defined by particles passing through a unit control
           volume (electrons) or energy-levels (e.g. the case of X-rays).
           Details depend on the model.
         * Another explicit description is via theoretical models which may
           be relevant e.g. for X-ray spectroscopy
         
         Further details on how the interaction volume can be quantified
         is available in the literature for example':'
