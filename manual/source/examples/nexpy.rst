=============================
HDF5 in Python with ``nexpy``
=============================

NeXpy provides a higher level API on top of h5py :ref:`Example-H5py`. While
h5py provides a basic API to read and write HDF5 files, NeXpy enriches this
API with NeXus specific utilities.

Please refer to the NeXpy documentation: https://nexpy.github.io/nexpy/.
